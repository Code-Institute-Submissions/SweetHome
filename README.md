* Design
    * Color Scheme
        * I've chosen for 2 popping colors that go well together to make the company stand out.
        For the rest I've kept the color scheme simple to give the attention to the two main colors.
        I like to go for a darker and a bit of a lighter color for easy use, because you can use a lighter color to stand out on a darker background and visa versa.
    * Typography
        * For this site I've chosen to use two fonts.
        First of all I've used Open Sans for the main text for easy reading, because I want the user to be comfortable.
        The user is looking for a house to feel comfortable in, so the site should fit with this feeling.
        As my second font I've chosen  for Poiret One.
        With this font I want the important pieces of text and the logo to really stand out, to fit with a company that stands out.
        I want it to give the site a bit of a luxary feeling with this font as well.
        Offcourse I also wanted to combine to fonts that go well with each other.
    * Imagery
        * The images on this page would be from the houses that are up for rental.
        In case there is no team image, I've created a default images that fits well with the rest of the website.
